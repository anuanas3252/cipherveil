Defense and military organizations employ diverse covert communication methods to interact with each other and their operatives. However, many of these techniques are susceptible to interception, decryption, or exposure by adversaries. Consequently, there is a critical requirement for more secure and resilient approaches to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information, particularly when sharing it with RAW agents or other relevant parties. In this system, custom ciphers are employed to encrypt or decrypt sensitive information. These ciphers can be tailored to meet specific security requirements, ensuring robust protection for confidential data. Additionally, the system incorporates steganography, a technique that allows the hidden embedding of information within seemingly innocuous files, such as images. By concealing the encoded data within an image, the system achieves a dual layer of security: the encrypted content remains confidential, while the steganographic cover ensures that the presence of hidden data is inconspicuous.
Overall, this proposed system combines cryptographic strength with covert communication, making it a powerful tool for secure information exchange and protection against unauthorized access.
